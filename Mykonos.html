 According to archaeological finds on the island but also in historical sources, the ancient city of Mykonos was founded in the 11th century by Iones from Athens who with their leader Ippokli, son of Nilea, settled in the place of present day Chora. Mykonos has close ties to Delos and was a member of the Delian alliance. During the height of Delos, Mykonos experienced prosperity due to the economic boom of the neighboring island but with the disaster of Delos it fell into obscurity..
				</p>
				<p>
					After a Byzantine period, from 1204 with the fall of the City to the Franks, the island is taken over by the Venetians. Since then many have passed through the island: Catalans, pirates occasionally, Turks of course and for a short period during the period of Great Aikaterinis and Orlof, the Russians as well until the liberation of 1821.
			  </p>
              <p>In about the middle of the 20th century, Mykonos “was discovered” by the locals and foreigners resulting in becoming one of the most touristic sites in the world. The inhabitants easily adapted to the new conditions, a fact which produced the successful tourist model of Mykonos. Led by intuition and hard work, the people of Mykonos ensured their island glory and wealth. </p>
              <p>Today the island of Mykonos is supplementing their infrastructure, improving the services offered and firmly claiming an eminent position in international tourism.</p>
